                    <p class="article-row-content-description">I was born October 6th, 2001 in the Bronx, NY. I was greeted into this world by such a large family. I'm pretty sure even my current barber was there. My great-grandma from my mom's side gave me my first bath.</p>

                    <p class="article-row-content-description">Soon after I was born, my mother brought me to the Dominican Republic where I finally got to meet my dad. We lived with my father's side of the family which consisted of three aunts, my grandma, and great-grandma. My grandma owned a salon and we all helped around the salon when we could.</p>
                    <p class="article-row-content-description"> I wouldn't trade my experience in the Dominican Republic for anything. There was a friendly culture. All the neighbors knew each other. The commuity would always be there for each other. And we definitely knew how to turn any situation into a god time. </p>

                    <p class="article-row-content-description">After much consideration, my mother and I decided to leave our family in the Dominican Republic and pursue a better life in the United States. We first moved to Brooklyn where three other aunts took care of me while my mom worked two jobs. We lived in a small one bedroom tenement wiith a shared kitchen and bathroom.</p>
                    <p class="article-row-content-description"> After a year of living in such conditions, the great-grandma that gave me my first bath called us and allowed us to come live with her back in the Bronx. I've been living in the Bronx ever since. </p>

I am constantly pushed out of my comfort zone and challenged intellectually and for that I will forever be grateful.</p>
